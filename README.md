# Creating and styling a simple website with HTML & CSS

Your goal for this takehome assignment is to create a webpage that resembles the template image below (no need to worry about getting the colors exactly right). We have provided you with some starter code in the `index.html` and `src/styles.css` files to help you get started. We've also included the image files embedded in the template page.

## Challenges
If you're interested, here are a few suggestions for additions/modifications you can make to this website:
* Add an 'Apply' button at the bottom and link it to a website
* Add social media icons at the bottom of the page and link them to social media pages
* Give the About, FAQ, and Sponsors sections rounded corners using the [border-radius property](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_borders.asp)
* Play around with the CSS [hover effects](https://www.w3schools.com/csSref/sel_hover.asp)
